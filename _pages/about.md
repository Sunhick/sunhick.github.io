# Hello, I'm Sunil Murthy

Software Engineer with **8+ years of experience** building enterprise-grade systems, device management solutions, and contributing to open-source technologies. My expertise spans from low-level systems programming to modern cloud-native applications, with focus on **authentication systems**, **distributed architecture**, and **formal verification**.

## Background

I've evolved from writing system-level code in C/C++ to architecting enterprise solutions that serve thousands of users. My journey includes building large-scale applications with Java and C#/.NET, embracing cloud-native development with AWS, and currently diving deep into TLA+ for formal system verification. I'm also an active contributor to major projects like **Chromium**.

## Core Expertise

- **Security & Authentication** - Enterprise authentication systems, OAuth2/OpenID Connect, cryptographic solutions
- **Distributed Systems** - Cell-based architectures, fault-tolerant systems, formal verification with TLA+
- **Cloud & Open Source** - AWS cloud-native applications, Chromium contributions, developer tools

## Philosophy

I believe great software is **reliable**, **secure**, and **maintainable**. My approach focuses on:

- **Correctness** - Using formal methods like TLA+ to verify system properties
- **Security by Design** - Building security into every layer from the start
- **Scalability** - Designing systems that grow gracefully
- **Collaboration** - Code reviews, knowledge sharing, and open-source contributions
- **Continuous Learning** - Staying current with emerging technologies

## Beyond Code

I'm actively involved in the developer community through open-source contributions, technical writing, and mentoring. I enjoy sharing knowledge about formal verification, distributed systems, and security best practices while helping junior developers grow in their careers.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing technical challenges, new opportunities, or collaborating on interesting projects.
