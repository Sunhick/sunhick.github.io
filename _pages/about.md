## Hello, I'm Sunil Murthy

I'm a passionate software engineer and technology enthusiast with extensive experience in building scalable systems, device management solutions, and contributing to cutting-edge technologies. My expertise spans multiple programming languages including C/C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Python, with a focus on system architecture, security, and formal verification.

### My Journey

My journey in technology has been driven by a deep curiosity about system design and the fundamental principles that make complex software systems work reliably. From low-level system programming to high-level architectural patterns, I've developed expertise across the entire technology stack.

I'm particularly passionate about formal methods and system verification, currently learning TLA+ to formally verify distributed systems. This reflects my commitment to building not just functional software, but provably correct and reliable systems.

### What I Do

**Device Management & System Architecture**
- Building comprehensive client device management and monitoring systems
- Designing scalable cell-based architectural patterns for distributed systems
- Implementing fault-tolerant systems with automated failover and recovery mechanisms

**Authentication & Security**
- Developing secure authentication systems with fine-grained authorization mechanisms
- Implementing cryptographic solutions and digital signature systems
- Building security-first applications with threat modeling and vulnerability assessment

**System Verification & Formal Methods**
- Using TLA+ to formally verify distributed systems and ensure correctness properties
- Applying formal verification techniques to critical system components
- Developing tools and frameworks for automated system verification

**Cloud Technologies & AWS**
- Extensive experience with AWS services for scalable cloud-native applications
- Implementing microservices architectures with containerization and orchestration
- Building CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code solutions

**Open Source & Chromium Development**
- Active contributor to various open-source projects and community tools
- Contributing to the Chromium project with focus on performance and web standards
- Maintaining and developing developer tools and utilities

### My Approach

I believe in building systems that are not only functional but also provably correct and secure. My development philosophy centers around:

- **Formal Verification**: Using mathematical methods like TLA+ to prove system correctness
- **Security-First Design**: Implementing security considerations from the ground up
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designing systems that can grow and adapt to changing requirements
- **Open Source Collaboration**: Contributing to and learning from the global developer community
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with emerging technologies and best practices
